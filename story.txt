Updated XIAO firmware, with MT8808 code and new keyboard mapping everything finally works.
Need also positional mapping definition and maybe German keymaps?

PCBs arrived. C16/C64 designator for connector is not visible on silkscreen.
Need to update XIAO firmware:
- use MT8808 mapping
- drop joystick mode, extra keys, C128 keymaps
- add C16 keymap as default (positional and symbolic, positional default)
- rename to c16-keyb

Quickly redesigned using c128 keyboard as the basis. Replaced MT8816 by MT8808. Ordered.
